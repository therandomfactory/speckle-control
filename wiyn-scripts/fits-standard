HDU:       any
VALUE:     string
COMMENT:   author of the data
DEFINITION: The value field shall contain a character string
identifying who compiled the information in the data associated with
the header. This keyword is appropriate when the data originate in a
published paper or are compiled from many sources.

KEYWORD:   BITPIX
REFERENCE: FITS Standard 
STATUS:    manditory
HDU:       any
VALUE:     integer
RANGE:     -64,-32,8,16,32
COMMENT:   bits per data value
DEFINITION: The value field shall contain an integer.  The absolute
value is used in computing the sizes of data structures.  It shall
specify the number of bits that represent a data value.

KEYWORD:   BLANK
REFERENCE: FITS Standard 
STATUS:    reserved
HDU:       image
VALUE:     integer
COMMENT:   value used for undefined array elements
DEFINITION: This keyword shall be used only in primary array headers or
IMAGE extension headers with positive values of BITPIX (i.e., in arrays
with integer data).  Columns 1-8 contain the string, `BLANK   ' (ASCII
blanks in columns 6-8).  The value field shall contain an integer that
specifies the representation of array values whose physical values are

COMMENT:   is physical blocksize a multiple of 2880?
DEFINITION: This keyword may be used only in the primary header.  It
shall appear within the first 36 card images of the FITS file.  (Note:
This keyword thus cannot appear if NAXIS is greater than 31, or if
NAXIS is greater than 30 and the EXTEND keyword is present.) Its
presence with the required logical value of T advises that the physical
block size of the FITS file on which it appears may be an integral
multiple of the logical record length, and not necessarily equal to
it.  Physical block size and logical record length may be equal even if
this keyword is present or unequal if it is absent.  It is reserved
primarily to prevent its use with other meanings. Since the issuance of
version 1 of the standard, the BLOCKED keyword has been deprecated.

describing the physical units in which the quantities in the array,
after application of BSCALE and BZERO, are expressed.   The units of
all FITS header keyword values, with the exception of measurements of
angles, should conform with the recommendations in the IAU Style
Manual. For angular measurements given as floating point values and
specified with reserved keywords, degrees are the recommended units
(with the units, if specified, given as 'deg').

DEFINITION:  If the FITS file may contain extensions, a card image with
the keyword EXTEND and the value field containing the logical value T
must appear in the  primary header immediately after the last NAXISn
card image, or, if NAXIS=0, the NAXIS card image.  The presence of this
keyword with the value T in the primary header does not require that
extensions be present.

KEYWORD:   EXTLEVEL
REFERENCE: FITS Standard 
STATUS:    reserved
HDU:       extension
VALUE:     integer
RANGE:     [1:]
DEFAULT:   1
COMMENT:   hierarchical level of the extension
DEFINITION: The value field shall contain an integer, specifying the
level in a hierarchy of extension levels of the extension header
containing it.  The value shall be 1 for the highest level; levels with
a higher value of this keyword shall be subordinate to levels with a
lower value. If the EXTLEVEL keyword is absent, the file should be
treated as if the value were 1. This keyword is used to describe an
extension and should not appear in the primary header.

RANGE:     [0:999]
COMMENT:   number of axes
DEFINITION: The value field shall contain a non-negative integer no
greater than 999, representing the number of axes in the associated
data array. A value of zero signifies that no data follow the header in
the HDU.  In the context of FITS 'TABLE' or 'BINTABLE' extensions, the
value of NAXIS is always 2.

KEYWORD:   NAXISn
REFERENCE: FITS Standard 
STATUS:    mandatory
HDU:       any
VALUE:     integer
RANGE:     [0:]
COMMENT:   size of the axis
DEFINITION: The value field of this indexed keyword shall contain a
non-negative integer, representing the number of elements along axis n
of a data array.  The NAXISn must be present for all values n =
1,...,NAXIS, and for no other values of n. A value of zero for any of
the NAXISn signifies that no data follow the header in the HDU. If
NAXIS is equal to 0, there should not be any NAXISn keywords.

VALUE:     integer
COMMENT:   parameter count
DEFINITION: The value field shall contain an integer that shall be used
in any way appropriate to define the data structure, consistent with
Eq. 5.2 in the FITS Standard.   This keyword was originated for use
with FITS Random Groups and represented the number of parameters
preceding each group. It has since been used in 'BINTABLE' extensions
to represent the size of the data heap following the main data table.
In most other cases its value will be zero.

KEYWORD:   PSCALn
REFERENCE: FITS Standard 
STATUS:    reserved
HDU:       groups
VALUE:     real
DEFAULT:   1.0
COMMENT:   parameter scaling factor
DEFINITION: This keyword is reserved for use within the FITS Random
Groups structure.  This keyword shall be used, along with the PZEROn
keyword, when the nth FITS group parameter value is not the true
physical value, to transform the group parameter value to the true
physical values it represents, using the equation, physical_value =
PZEROn + PSCALn * group_parameter_value.  The value field shall contain
a floating point number representing the coefficient of the linear
term, the scaling factor between true values and group parameter values
at zero offset.  The default value for this keyword is 1.0.

KEYWORD:   PTYPEn
REFERENCE: FITS Standard 
STATUS:    reserved
HDU:       groups
VALUE:     string
COMMENT:   name of random groups parameter
DEFINITION: This keyword is reserved for use within the FITS Random
Groups structure.  The value field shall contain a character string
giving the name of parameter n.  If the PTYPEn keywords for more than
one value of n have the same associated name in the value field, then
the data value for the parameter of that name is to be obtained by
adding the derived data values of the corresponding parameters.  This
rule provides a mechanism by which a random parameter may have more
precision than the accompanying data array elements; for example, by
summing two 16-bit values with the first scaled relative to the other
such that the sum forms a number of up to 32-bit precision.

KEYWORD:   PZEROn
REFERENCE: FITS Standard 
STATUS:    reserved
HDU:       groups
VALUE:     real
DEFAULT:   0.0
COMMENT:   parameter scaling zero point 
DEFINITION: This keyword is reserved for use within the FITS Random
Groups structure.  This keyword shall be used, along with the PSCALn
keyword, when the nth FITS group parameter value is not the true
physical value, to transform the group parameter value to the physical
value.  The value field shall contain a floating point number,
representing the true value corresponding to a group parameter value of
zero.  The default value for this keyword is 0.0.  The transformation
equation is as follows: physical_value = PZEROn + PSCALn *
group_parameter_value.

KEYWORD:   REFERENC
REFERENCE: FITS Standard 
STATUS:    reserved
HDU:       any

HDU:       primary
VALUE:     logical
COMMENT:   does file conform to the Standard?
DEFINITION: The SIMPLE keyword is required to be the first keyword in
the primary header of all FITS files. The value field shall contain a
logical constant with the value T if the file conforms to the
standard.  This keyword is mandatory for the primary header and is not
permitted in extension headers.  A value of F signifies that the file
does not conform to this standard.

KEYWORD:   TBCOLn

the FITS Standard in which the value string has the format '(l,m,n...)'
where l, m, n,... are the dimensions of the array.

KEYWORD:   TDISPn
REFERENCE: FITS Standard 
STATUS:    reserved
HDU:       table
VALUE:     string
COMMENT:   display format
DEFINITION: The value field of this indexed keyword shall contain a
character string describing the format recommended for the display of
the contents of field n.  If the table value has been scaled, the
physical value shall be displayed.  All elements in a field shall be
displayed with a single, repeated format. For purposes of display, each
byte of bit (type X) and byte (type B) arrays is treated as an unsigned
integer. Arrays of type A may be terminated with a zero byte.  Only the
format codes in Table 8.6, discussed in section 8.3.4 of the FITS
Standard, are permitted for encoding. The format codes must be
specified in upper case.  If the Bw.m, Ow.m, and Zw.m formats are not
readily available to the reader, the Iw.m display format may be used
instead, and if the ENw.d and ESw.d formats are not available, Ew.d may
be used.  The meaning of this keyword is not defined for fields of type
P in the Standard but may be defined in conventions using such fields.
