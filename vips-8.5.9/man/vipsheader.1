.TH VIPSHEADER 1 "12 July 1990"
.SH NAME
vipsheader \- prints information about an image file
.SH SYNOPSIS
vipsheader [OPTIONS ...] files ...
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B vipsheader(1)
prints image header fields to stdout. 

.SH OPTIONS

.TP
.B -a, --all
Show all fields. Fields are displayed to be convenient for humans to read, so
binary data, for example, is summarized rather than simply copied.

.TP
.B -f FIELD, --field=FIELD
Print value of 
.B FIELD 
from image header. Fields are printed in a way suitable for programs to
understand, so, for example, binary data is base64-encoded and printed as a
stream of characters. 

The special field name 
.B getext
prints the VIPS extension block: the XML defining the image metadata. You can 
alter this, then reattach with 
.B vipsedit(1).

.SH EXAMPLES
 $ vipsheader -f Xsize ~/pics/*.v
